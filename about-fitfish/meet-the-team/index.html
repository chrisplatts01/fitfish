          <p>Tracy became a Christian in 2002 whilst attending an Alpha course.  For over six years she served in the ecumenical women’s ministry Aglow International, including four years as President of the local Reading group.

Tracy is now increasingly involved in speaking on Alpha courses & leading & preaching at services at her church in this new season. Her passion is for everyone to really grasp who they are in Christ & walk in the freedom He died to give us. She has struggled with emotional eating for most of her life but, with the help of God & Fitfish (she was its first personal training client!), she has made significant changes over the last few years, slowly losing three stone in weight.  She has also discovered a love of running, which led to her completing the London Marathon in April 2013!  Tracy’s career background is in publishing & training but she now works as Membership Officer for a small, local charity serving people living with Multiple Sclerosis. Her interests include reading, theatre & cricket!
