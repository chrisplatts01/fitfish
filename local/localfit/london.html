            <p><img src="/_/img/localfit/tony_running.jpg" alt="Tony Running" align="left" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;" />I am a qualified personal trainer, based in the city of London. I work with motivated people everyday, helping them gain confidence through transforming their diet, nutrition, exercise and stress management.</p>
            <p>I am a national champion boxer, county runner and strength endurance athlete. I have worked in Londons best personal training gyms and have been running my own company since 2009. My clients have gained muscle, lost fat and improved their self confidence. The main problems i specialise in is in teaching my clients how to know the true nature their mind and body so that they choose training and nutrition that will nurture them back. Often the main request i try to meet is to get results that they can see and feel, that fit into their lifestyles and that they can maintain even when they fall off the wagon.</p>
            <p>My methodology is multidisciplinary  and comprehensive using clinical, laboratory and field based examinations, assessments and protocols to gain a complete profile of each individual client. I bring in experts from varying fields of science such as gene testing and holistic therapy such as meditation and relaxation, to help create and deliver definitive programme designs. </p>
            <p>My mission is to help eradicate the damage caused by unscrupulous diet and weight loss companies that have created false expectations and ideas about health and well being. I am known for being loving but firm and my clients leave me feeling inspired and re-energised.</p>
