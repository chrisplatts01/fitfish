				<dt>Do you have to take part in everything?</dt>
				<dd>Not at all, everything is optional and the whole feel about the weekend is very relaxed. It’s your time and your space and so you can do as much or as little as you like.</dd>
				<dt>How fit do you have to be?</dt>
				<dd>Each class is designed to be adaptable to the individual guests and people will be able to work out at their own intensity and pace. If you are unsure of your suitability to take part in an exercise programme we recommend that you seek the advice of a doctor.</dd>
				<dt>I haven’t exercised in a long time does that matter?</dt>
				<dd>Each class is designed to be adaptable to the individual guests and people will be able to work at their own intensity and pace. You can challenge and stretch yourself as much as you want to. If you are unsure of your suitability to take part in an exercise programme or haven’t exercised for a long time we recommend that you seek the advice of a doctor.</dd>
				<dt>Do I need to check with my doctor before I come?</dt>
				<dd>If you have any medical conditions or haven’t exercised in a while then we would always recommend you check with your GP before you embark on anything new.</dd>
				<dt>Is there a minimum or a maximum age?</dt>
				<dd>There is no maximum age, we expect a whole range of ages on the weekends. However if you haven’t exercised for a while whatever your age we recommend that you consult your doctor.</dd>
				<dd>The weekends are designed for adults and we wouldn’t recommend Fitfish for children. However if you are between 14 and 18 and would like to come along then you need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian who will accept responsibility for you at all times.</dd>
				<dt>Are the exercise sessions compulsory?</dt>
				<dd>No, everything on the weekend is optional and you can go to as much or as little as you want.</dd>
				<dt>I’m not a Christian, is it for Christians only?</dt>
				<dd>A lot of the content for the weekend is to motivate and inspire Christians in their walk with God, however everyone is more than welcome to come along on a Fitfish weekend and you can come to as much or as little as you like</dd>
				<dt>I live locally, can I just come for the days?</dt>
				<dd>Please contact the office to discuss this.</dd>
				<dt>What do I need to bring?</dt>

				<dt>Will I be able to have a shower after each session?</dt>
				<dd>Yes if you’re quick and fancy one, otherwise a quick wash and a change of top between sessions might be enough. There will always be time before meals and meetings to have a shower.</dd>
				<dt>I don’t have an exercise mat, do I have to buy one?</dt>
				<dd>An exercise mat will offer more support to your spine but a towel will be ok. Shops such as Decathlon and Aldi offer exercise mats from as little as £2.99</dd>
				<dt>How can I book?</dt>
				<dd>Please fill in the booking enquiry form on line, we will then contact you to advise if a place is available and to give payment details.</dd>
				<dt>Do I have to pay all in one go?</dt>
				<dd>No, a £50 deposit is needed initially and then the remaining balance 2 months before the weekend.</dd>
				<dt>I don’t know who I want to share with, does that matter?</dt>
				<dd>No, we will match you up with someone of the same sex and similar age</dd>
				<dt>How many people will be on the weekend?</dt>
				<dd>Between 12 and 60!</dd>
				<dt>Will the exercise classes be inside or outside?</dt>
				<dd>There will be a mixture of activity inside and out depending on the class and the weather</dd>
				<dt>How much do the massages cost?</dt>
				<dd>There are lots of different massages available, contact the office to find out more</dd>
				<dt>What’s the food like?</dt>
				<dd>All food is home-made and healthy and isn’t calorie restricted</dd>
				<dt>Will I lose weight over the weekend?</dt>
				<dd>If your energy intake is less than your energy expenditure then yes will lose weight if you chose to. Meal portions won’t be calorie counted and restricted, it will be up to you to decide how much you would like to eat. Fitfish Nutritional Advisers and Instructors will be able to advise should you wish.</dd>
