					<blockquote class="testimonial">
						<p>Just a little note to say thank-you for a great weekend. It was so much fun ..... I think though you have managed to achieve something truly unique ..... a fun weekend, in a lovely location, with an opportunity to try new things , with God at the core in so many ways. Sometimes I think Christian events can be slightly cringey - but most definitely not the case on a Fitfish weekend! It was fun to try the boxing and hip hop (think we are a long way off a Britain's Got Talent performance!!). I thought Jen's talks were inspired ..... Having met you all now, coming along again would feel like meeting up with friends which would be lovely!</p>

						<p>Thank you for a completely fabulous Fitfish weekend! I have had so much energy today it has been unbelievable - I'm not sure whether it's been a spiritual side effect of the weekend or the lack of vast quantities of sugar, but either way Fitfish is responsible ;-) Thank you so much, every aspect of the weekend was completely brilliant...</p>

					<p>Last weekend was definitely my best short break I was really blessed and my husband said that he was inspired. I have told friends at work and family about the weekend and also now take my rucksack to work! This weekend was definitely what we needed and I am trying to look at the food we eat, the time we eat and the amount of exercise we take. I am also praying for you all and the expansion of this organisation because I believe that it is a God given vision.</p>

					<p>It was much more relaxing than I thought it would be and there was no pressure to take part in anything, you could do as much or as little as you wanted and there's loads of space and amazing surrounds to relax in. I came home feeling really relaxed and inspired!'</p>

					<p>I just wanted to say thank you again for such an amazing weekend! I checked out your website again and would very much like to go to St Katherine's at Henley-on-Thames  on 25-27th November. I see you have just one single room left so realised I'd better try and reserve it fast if it's still available. Really enjoying enthusing myself to carry on the tips I learnt using those brilliant information cards that you gave us and I just wanted to commend you on all the details you added to the event to make it so special. And what a brilliant team! I'm already looking forward to coming back!</p>

					<p>I had such a brilliant experience at the weekend! I LOVED meeting everyone and spending time with fantastic new and interesting people. I feel sooooo refreshed and relaxed! I loved having a break away with activity and healthy food. It is rare that I take time out for myself away from the hustle and bustle and I feel truly physically, emotionally and spiritually invigorated.</p>
